# Evaluating Same-Different Models
This simple codebase allows you to load a fine-tuned model from the paper [Deep Neural Networks Can Learn Generalizable Same-Different Visual Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09612) by Tartaglini et al. (2023). 

## Getting started
Begin by cloning this repo onto your local machine. Navigate to the directory where you would like this codebase to be installed and run: 
```
git clone https://github.com/alexatartaglini/same-different-eval
```
